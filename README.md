# samd21-dma-gpio_high_time_and_period
This is a re-write of my samd21-gpio_high_and_low_durations project using DMA to move the CC0 and CC1 counter values instead of software. I wanted to see if DMA would improve performance (be able to sample faster/shorter pulses). The result is that DMA has about the same overhead as a tight software ISR loop. High pulses as short as 300ns can be sampled as long as the period is 1000ns or greater. This is about identical to the ISR performance.
